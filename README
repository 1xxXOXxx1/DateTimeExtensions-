DateTime Extensions

This extensions for System.DateTime adds methods to make calculations based on working days.
A working day is defined in IWorkingDayCultureInfo in two ways:
- IsWorkingDay(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek)
- IsWorkingDay(DateTime date)

The first defines witch day of the week is a working day (by default, working days are all week days except weekends).
The last does the same as the first, but it's also able to check for any holiday. By default, no holidays are defined,
unless there is a IWorkingDayCultureInfo implemented for the current thread CultureInfo.

Avaiable CultureInfo implementations:
- pt-PT
- pt-BR
- en-US
- en-GB
- fr-FR
- de-DE
- es-ES

your culture is not listed here? You have two options. You can wait until I get the mood to build it, or you can get
your hands dirty and contribute it.
